This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted before the callback function in `useRef` is executed.  This typically happens when a component is quickly unmounted (e.g., navigating away from a screen) before a `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, or asynchronous operation within `useRef` completes.  The callback tries to update the state or interact with the already unmounted component, causing the error.
